. Types
What: Canonical TypeScript types (models.ts) that match your DB schema and app needs.
Why: They are the ‚Äúcontract‚Äù for all data, ensuring type safety and clarity everywhere.
2. Stores (Source Stores)
What: Table-aligned, session-scoped Svelte stores (e.g., scoresSource, eventSource, orgSource).
Why: Hold and sync the actual data you care about, fetched from Supabase, with real-time updates if needed.
3. Utils
What: Pure, stateless functions for grouping, aggregating, sorting, formatting, and calculating.
Why: Keep business logic DRY, testable, and reusable across stores, views, and components.
4. View Stores (Feature/Derived Stores)
What: Svelte stores (often derived) that combine, transform, or aggregate data from one or more source stores, tailored for a specific page or feature (e.g., liveLeaderboardStore, rotatingOrgLeaderboardStore).
Why: Present data in exactly the shape needed for the UI, without polluting the raw data stores.
5. Components
What: Svelte components that render UI, subscribe to view stores, and use utils for formatting or business logic.
Why: Keep UI logic clean, declarative, and reactive‚Äîno data fetching or business logic here.
6. Pages (+page.svelte / +page.ts)
What: Route-level SvelteKit files that compose components, wire up stores, and handle page-level logic (e.g., routing, layout).
Why: Serve as the entry point for each user-facing screen.

Why This Order?
Each layer builds on the guarantees and structure of the previous one.
Types are the foundation for everything.
Source stores are the single source of truth for data.
Utils keep logic DRY and reusable.
View stores shape data for the UI, without duplicating or mutating the source.
Components and pages focus only on presentation and composition, not data management.
This approach gives you:

Maximum clarity and maintainability.
Zero duplication or data drift.
Easy onboarding for new devs.
A clean path for scaling up features and complexity.

  title: z.string().min(1, 'Title is required'),
  slug: z.string().min(1, 'Slug is required'),
  short_code: z.string().length(6, 'Short code must be 6 characters'),
  access_uuid: z.string().uuid('Invalid UUID format'),

  event_date: z.string().datetime().nullable(),
  published: z.boolean().nullable(),
  settings_json: z.record(z.unknown()).nullable()
});
